Changes from 5.1.0 to 5.1.1
---------------------------

1. Infrastructure upgrades: Bison 3.7.1, Gettext 0.20.2.

2. asort and asorti now allow FUNCTAB and SYMTAB as the first argument if a
   second destination array is supplied. Similarly, using either array as
   the second argument is now a fatal error. Additionally, using either
   array as the destination for split(), match(), etc. also causes a
   fatal error.

3. The new -I/--trace option prints a trace of the byte codes as they
   are executed.

4. A number of subtle bugs relating to MPFR mode that caused differences
   between regular operation and MPFR mode have been fixed.

5. The API now handles MPFR/GMP values slightly differently, requiring
   different memory management for those values. See the manual for the
   details if you have an extension using those values.  As a result,
   the minor version was incremented.

6. The duplication of m4 and build-aux directories between the main
   directory and the extension directory has been removed. This
   simplifies the distribution.

7. The test suite has been improved, making it easier to run the entire
   suite with -M. Use `GAWK_TEST_ARGS=-M make check' to do so.

8. Profiling and pretty-printing output has been modified slightly so
   that functions are presented in a reasonable order with respect
   to the namespaces that contain them.

Changes from 5.0.1 to 5.1.0
---------------------------

1. The major version of the API is bumped to 3, something that should
   have happened at the 5.0.0 release but didn't.

2. A number of memory leak issues have been fixed.

3. Infrastructure upgrades: Bison 3.5.4, Texinfo 6.7, Gettext 0.20.1,
   Automake 1.16.2.

4. The indexing in the manual has been thoroughly revised, in particular
   making use of the facilities in Texinfo 6.7.  That version (or newer)
   must be used to format the manual.

5. MSYS2 is now supported out-of-the-box by configure.

6. Several bugs have been fixed.  See the ChangeLog for details.

Changes from 5.0.0 to 5.0.1
---------------------------

1. A number of ChangeLog.1 files that were left out of the distribution
   have been restored.

2. Multiple syntax errors should no longer be able to cause a core dump.

3. Sandbox mode now disallows assigning new filename values in ARGV that
   were not there when gawk was invoked.

4. There are many small documentation improvements in the manual.

5. The new argument "no-ext" to --lint disables ``XXX is a gawk extension''
   lint warnings.

6. Infrastructure upgrades: Bison 3.4.

7. A number of bugs, some of them quite significant, have been fixed.
   See the ChangeLog for details.

Changes from 4.2.1 to 5.0.0
---------------------------

1. Support for the POSIX standard %a and %A printf formats has been added.

2. The test infrastructure has been greatly improved, simplifying the
   contents of test/Makefile.am and making it possible to generate
   pc/Makefile.tst from test/Makefile.in.

3. The regex routines have been replaced with those from GNULIB, allowing
   me to stop carrying forward decades of changes against the original
   ones from GLIBC.

4. Infrastructure upgrades: Bison 3.3, Automake 1.16.1, Gettext 0.19.8.1,
   makeinfo 6.5.

5. The undocumented configure option and code that enabled the use of
   non-English "letters" in identifiers is now gone.

6. The `--with-whiny-user-strftime' configuration option is now gone.

7. The code now makes some stronger assumptions about a C99 environment.

8. PROCINFO["platform"] yields a string indicating the platform for
   which gawk was compiled.

9. Writing to elements of SYMTAB that are not variable names now
   causes a fatal error. THIS CHANGES BEHAVIOR.

10. Comment handling in the pretty-printer has been reworked almost completely
    from scratch. As a result, comments in many corner cases that were
    previously lost are now included in the formatted output.

11. Namespaces have been implemented! See the manual.  One consequence of this
    is that files included with -i, read with -f, and command line program
    segments must all be self-contained syntactic units. E.g., you can no
    longer do something like this:

   	gawk -e 'BEGIN {' -e 'print "hello" }'

12. Gawk now uses the locale settings for ignoring case in single byte
    locales, instead of hardwiring in Latin-1.

13. A number of bugs, some of them quite significant, have been fixed.
    See the ChangeLog for details.
