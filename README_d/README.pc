This is the README for GNU awk 4 under Windows32, OS/2, and DOS.

    Gawk has been compiled and tested under OS/2, DOS, and Windows32 using
the GNU development tools from DJ Delorie (DJGPP; DOS with special
support for long filenames on Windows), Eberhard Mattes (EMX; OS/2,
DOS, and Windows32 with rsxnt), and Jan-Jaap van der Heijden and Mumit Khan
(Mingw32; Windows32).

    The Cygwin environment (http://cygwin.com) may also be used
to compile and run gawk under Windows.  For Cygwin, building and
installation is the same as under Unix:

	tar -xvpzf gawk-4.0.x.tar.gz
	cd gawk-4.0.x
	./configure && make

The `configure' step takes a long time, but works otherwise.

******************************** N O T E **********************************
* The `|&' operator only works when gawk is compiled for Cygwin.  Neither *
* socket support nor two-way pipes work in any other Windows environment! *

Building gawk
-------------

Copy the files in the `pc' directory (EXCEPT for `ChangeLog') to the
directory with the rest of the gawk sources.  (The subdirectories of 
`pc' need not be copied.)  The Makefile contains a configuration 
section with comments, and may need to be edited in order to work
with your make utility.

The "prefix" line in the Makefile is used during the install of gawk
(and in building igawk.bat and igawk.cmd). Since the libraries for
gawk will be installed under $(prefix)/lib/awk (e.g., /gnu/lib/awk),
it is convenient to have this directory in DEFPATH of config.h. 

The makefile contains a number of targets for building various DOS and
OS/2 versions.  A list of targets will be printed if the make command is
given without a target.  As an example, to build gawk using the djgpp
tools, enter "make djgpp".


Testing and installing gawk
---------------------------

The command "make test" (and possibly "make install") requires several 
Unix-like tools, including an sh-like shell, sed, cp, and cmp.  Only 
dmake and GNU make are known to work on "make test".

There are two methods for the install: Method 1 uses a typical Unix-like 
approach and requires cat, cp, mkdir, sed, and sh; method 2 uses gawk 
and batch files. See the configuration section of the makefile.

The file test/Makefile will need some editing (especially for DOS). A
sample makefile with comments appears in pc/Makefile.tst, and can be
used to modify test/Makefile for your platform.  In addition, some
files in the test directory may need to have their end-of-line markers
converted, as described in Makefile.tst.

As with building gawk, the OS, shell, and long filename issues come into
play when testing, too.  If you are testing gawk on a LFN aware system with
some LFN aware tools, you may have problems if the shell that you specify in
test/Makefile is not LFN aware.  This problem will apply whether or not
you are building a LFN aware gawk.  See the comments in pc/Makefile.tst
for more information on this.

It is routine to install by hand, but note that the install target also
builds igawk.bat and igawk.cmd, which are used to add an include
facility to gawk (and which require sh).


Gawk thanks
-----------

The DOS maintainers wish to express their thanks to Eli Zaretskii
<eliz@gnu.org> for his work and for the many conversations concerning
gawk, make, and djgpp.  His FAQ for djgpp is essential reading, and he
was always willing to answer our questions (even when we didn't read
the relevant portions of the FAQ :).

We are indebted to Juan Grigera <juan@biophnet.unlp.edu.ar> for
additional help on changes for Windows32.


----
If you have any problems with the DOS or OS/2 versions of Gawk, 
please send bug reports (along with the version and compiler used) to 

   Scott Deifik, scottd.mail@sbcglobal.net (DOS versions)
or
   andreas.buening@nexgo.de (OS/2 version)

Support for Windows32 started in gawk-3.0.3.
