# Hello people,
# 
# i think i found a bug or something mysterious behaviour in
# gawk Version 3.0 patchlevel 0.
# 
# I am running on linux 2.0.25 under bash.
# 
# Could you please have a look at the following awk program
# an let me please know, if this is what i expect it to,
# namely a bug.
# 
# ----------- cut here --------------------------------------------
BEGIN	{
			# OS is linux 2.0.25
			# shell is bash
			# Gnu Awk (gawk) 3.0, patchlevel 0
			# The command i typed on the shell was "gawk -f <this_prog> -"

			#com = "cal 01 1997"
			if (PROCINFO["platform"] == "windows")
				com = ("type " SRCDIR "\\pipeio2.in")
			else
				com = ("cat " SRCDIR "/pipeio2.in")

			# Don't use empty lines, because Windows ECHO does
			# something different when invoked without arguments
			while ((com | getline fnam) > 0 && fnam != "") {

#				com_tr = "echo " fnam " | tr [0-9]. ..........."
#				com_tr = "echo " fnam " | sed 's/[0-9]/./g'"
				if (PROCINFO["platform"] == "windows")
					com_tr = "(^(echo " fnam "^)) | pipeio2.bat"
				else
					com_tr = "echo " fnam " | sed \"s/[0-9]/./g\""
				# print "\'" com_tr "\'"
				print "'" com_tr "'"

				com_tr | getline nam
				print nam

				# please run that program and take a look at the
				# output. I think this is what was expected.

				# Then comment in the following 4 lines and see
				# what happens. I expect the first pipe "com | getline"
				# not to be close, but i think this is exactly what happens
				# So, is this ok ?

				if (close(com_tr) < 0) {
					print ERRNO
					break
				}
			}

			close(com)
		}
# ----------- cut here --------------------------------------------
# 
# There is another thing i do not understand.
# Why doesn't the awk - command "close" reports an
# error, if i would say close("abc") which i had never
# openend ?
