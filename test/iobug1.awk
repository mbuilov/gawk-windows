# Subject: gawk 3.1.4: reproducible hang, regression from 3.1.3

# Hi,
# 
# A Debian user reported[0] gawk 3.1.4 broke a (relatively) complex
# program that makes extensive use of awk, called 'apt-move'.  I finally
# managed to reduced the problem down to a 3 line test case, enclosed
# below[1].
# 
# I believe the problem comes from the following code, introduced in
# 3.1.4:
# 
# [io.c, line 560]
# | 	for (rp = red_head; rp != NULL; rp = rp->next) {
# | 		if ((rp->flag & RED_EOF) && tree->type == Node_redirect_pipein) {
# | 			if (rp->pid != -1)
# | 				wait_any(0);
# | 		}
# 
# The problem is that, if we have an existing redirect which is a simple
# file redirect[b] and it's hit EOF and we try to create a new '|'
# redirect[c], this new code will try to wait(2) and if there are any
# other redirects which _did_ spawn a child (like [a]) the wait() will
# hang indefinitely waiting for it to exit.
# 
# Hope that makes sense :)
